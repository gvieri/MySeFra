This is a simple framework written taking in account some IT security problems. 

So it uses salt, divide anagraphical users from staf users... It has some (I'll hope) interesting thing as user roles that impact on the allowed user's actions.

In future it will take in account other problems... These things to do will be listed in todolist.txt. 

The license is Apache License 2.0 and GPL V.2 you are allowed to choose... Take in account the fact that it is used bootstrap.
